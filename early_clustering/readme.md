# Early clustering

This repo groups attempts to create clusters of buildings similar in their shape attributes and spatially close.

Several techniques were tried with variations in thresholds, pseudo-knn search, $\alpha$-shapes.

Majority of the scripts are written in R and some use postgresql queries.

### Potentially useful excerpts
- Connection to a postrgesql db from R
- DB query
- Clustering methods
- Writing graphs to PDF
- Some mapping with sf (outputs removed since data aren't _os_)
- Writing geodata
