# research
All finished, unfinished, abandoned scripts that are or never were used for my thesis

Scripts and notebooks are minimally curated and serve as a basis for reusing some contents when needed.

#### Themes and contents

##### Early clustering
Contains some tries for a clustering method taking into account both spatial proximity and attributes similarity.

##### GeoSOM
Contains a python package for GeoSOM analysis and several procedures for extracting data from OpenStreetMap, computing attributes and performing feature selection. Included are example notebooks and results

##### Machine learning and computer vision
Will hopefully be completed later on...

##### Others
Scripts that do not fit in one of the above folders.
